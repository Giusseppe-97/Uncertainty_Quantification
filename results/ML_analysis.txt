Important information regarding Statistical learning project:

Why validation:
	We use a training set to train the machine and separate data set to avoid overfitting.
	However: This biases the machine towards the separate set
▶ Performance on this set is not an unbiased estimate of real-world performance
▶ Solution: Separate the data into three distinct sets
	Train: Optimise the objective function
	Validation: Model selection by being able to compare different machine learning methods and get a sense of how well they work in practice 
	Test: Estimate performance
