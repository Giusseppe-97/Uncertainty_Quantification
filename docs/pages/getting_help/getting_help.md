## Help

If you encounter problems, I recommend the following strategies

+ Take a step back, and make sure you can run the [demos](../demos/demos.html)
  + [Getting started](../demos/getting_started.html) is a good place to start
  + Sometimes when running the codes, we forget that the Matlab has a folder system that won't allow to run the codes if you are not placed in the location of the file.
+ If that doesn't work, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Giusseppe-97/statistical_learning/issues)

+ If you don't hear back in 3 days, [email Jose Navarro](mailto:j.p.navarroposada@utuwente.nl)
