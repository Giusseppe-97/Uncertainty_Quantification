# Getting help

## Help

If you encounter problems, we recommend the following strategies

+ Take a step back, and make sure you can run the [demos](../demos/demos.html)
  + [Getting started](../demos/getting_started.html) is a good place to start
  

+ If that doesn't work, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Giusseppe-97/TheMiceCounter/issues)

+ If you don't hear back in 3 days, [email Jose Navarro](mailto:jpna227@uky.edu)
