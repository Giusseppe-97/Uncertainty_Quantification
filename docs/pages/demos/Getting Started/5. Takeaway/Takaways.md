Classical methods and finite element methods (FEM) are both used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), but they have some key differences. Classical methods, such as the Galerkin, and collocation methods, are based on a set of trial functions that are chosen to approximate the solution of the PDE. These methods typically rely on the use of orthogonality conditions and projection operators to obtain the approximate solution. The main advantage of classical methods is that they are relatively simple to implement and understand. However, their accuracy can be limited, especially for complex geometries and boundary conditions.FEM, on the other hand, is a more general and powerful technique for solving PDEs. It is based on the idea of breaking up the solution domain into a set of small, interconnected elements, and approximating the solution within each element using a set of basis functions. The solution is then obtained by solving a set of algebraic equations that are derived from the PDE and the boundary conditions. FEM is more versatile than classical methods, as it can handle a wide range of problems involving different geometries and boundary conditions. However, it can be more computationally intensive and requires specialized software to implement. In summary, classical methods are simpler but less accurate, while FEM is more accurate and versatile but requires more computational resources.
