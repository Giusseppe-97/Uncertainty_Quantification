# Getting started

If this is the first time going through the project, make sure you have [installed the repository](../../installation/installation.html) before trying the demos. Ideally, any computer is able to run the repository. Yet, you do need the Matlab software to run the Matlab codes. 

The information in this project comes from the following books:
