## What this demo does

This demo:

+ Explains how to use the entries at the top of the application. This includes:
    - Setting the input data 
    - Setting the output folder 
    - Setting the date frame 
    - Running the data selected. 
    - Using the Reset bottom. 

## Instructions

The first step after opening the application is to select both the location of data that is going to be used and the folder where you want to save the results. This can be set on the input and output entries, as shown in the image below:

After you have finished setting the time frame you are ready to Run the application. Click on the RUN button. Your results will take a second to appear in the lower part of the app. You can rerun new data by clicking the Reset button. Make sure you press this button before setting new data or running the application. This could cause problems in the App.
