The getting started link found here will guide you and showcase the main sections of this project. First, visit the background theory behind the Galerkin and the collocation methods. Then, visit the analysis tab, where you can see the example problems and the interpretation of their solutions. Finally, visit Matlab and python links to understand how to run the codes. For the Matlab code, you need to download them and run them on your own. This is better explained in the installation window on the left.
