# Conclusion of my UQ github page

## Overview

This repository is my final project for my Un certainty Quantification master's subject. I was supposed to write a report, but I wanted to go beyond the professor's expectations and make something useful for others studying this topic, not another written report in my university dropbox folder. Therefore, I decided to create this page. After submitting the project, which can have minor inconveniences (it is a hand-in assignment after all), I expect to improve it. Hopefully, I can keep growing it in the future with better explanations and revised codes. If you stumbled upon this repository and found it helpful, I would greatly appreciate it if you let me know.

I will add new tabs describing the new features as they get accomplished.
