## Overview

TheMiceCounter was initially designed to be an application takes a saved xlxs file and creates tables and graphs, specifically of mice lattices' data. Hence the name...

So far, this application can do just that, with some minor inconviniences that are being dealt with. Yet, it is expected to do much more. 

For instance, this application should have its own exe file that doesn't depend on a command prompt to function. The app should also be able to plot different types of plot, depending on the user's preferences.
On the other hand, it is intended for the app to be able to extract data from bigger database platforms such as RedCap. This would allow researchers to rapidly get a visualization of the data they have recorded.
