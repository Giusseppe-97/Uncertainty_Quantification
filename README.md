# UQ final project

In this project, I am first going to expain the theory behind the Galerkin and the collocation methods. After each topic, I am going to present the problems to resolve. I will thensolve them, and show my results. I am going to comment the codes so that the readers can recreate those results. Finally, I am going to conclude my takeaways from the project.

  + This project is written in Matlab for both the book examples and the independent example. 

Ideally, the repository should work on any computer that runs Matlab. Even if the main codes are witten for pc, when the repository is added to a mac it can be easily addapted. 

## Motivation

For the submission of this project, I was encouraged to not only find a solution to one Stochastic Galerkin problem and one Collocation Interpolation problem but to understand the undergoing theory behind them and also recreate a challenging example of the Galerkin Method for Poisson's equation. Personally, I wanted to get a better notion of when to use each technique and how well they can adapt different codes at least to find simple results. In the future, I would like to be able to employ this finite element method if I ever encounter such problems. Creating the Github page was an added value for the project. Even if this took me some weekend/holliday time, I wanted to have something tangible and accessible to others and not another report in my University Dropbox folder.
